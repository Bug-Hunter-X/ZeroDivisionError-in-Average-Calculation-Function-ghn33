This repository demonstrates a common error in Python: the ZeroDivisionError. The bug.py file contains a function to calculate the average of a list of numbers.  This function does not handle the case where an empty list is provided, resulting in a division by zero error. The bugSolution.py file shows a corrected version that handles this edge case gracefully, preventing the error.
